# [REQUIRED] Specify the full path to the LEAN repository's 'config' folder.
# This folder contains default stopword and spelling files, among other items.
# Items in this folder are loaded automatically at startup.

config_path: config

# [REQUIRED] Write the Lucene index to this folder.  If this folder does not
# exist it will be created.

outdir: tests/test_mongo/index

# [REQUIRED] Specify the analyzer to use.  An analyzer consists of a tokenizer
# and a chain of zero or more token filters.  The filters perform various
# transformations on the tokens as they pass down the chain.  The first four
# analyzers are provided by Lucene and are not customizable; the 'custom'
# analyzers can be easily altered and recompiled.

# org.apache.lucene.analysis.core.WhitespaceAnalyzer      Split text on whitespace only
# org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer    Lucene's default text analyzer
# org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.ClassicAnalyzer     Lucene's StandardAnalyzer pre v3.1
# org.apache.lucene.analysis.en.EnglishAnalyzer           Lucene's English-specific text analyzer
# analyzers.FormalAnalyzer                                GTRI analyzer for formal documents
# twitter.TwitterAnalyzer                                 GTRI custom analyzer for Twitter

analyzer: twitter.TwitterAnalyzer

# [REQUIRED FOR MONGO INPUT] access the mongo instance avialable at this host address
host: localhost

# [REQUIRED FOR MONGO INPUT] access the mongo instance served at this port
port: 27019

# [REQUIRED FOR MONGO INPUT] connect to this database
database: twitter

# [REQUIRED FOR MONGO INPUT] ingest tweets from this collection
collection: ows

# [REQUIRED FOR MONGO INPUT] collect up to this many tweets;
# using a value of -1 will result in no limit applied to the tweets collected
limit: -1

# [OPTIONAL] Specify the absolute path to a 'user' stopword file.  Use this
# file to give DocIndexer additional stopwords that should be removed from the
# token stream, but that are not contained in the default stopword list
# (found in the config folder).  This file can also be used to remove specific
# tokens that may not be of interest for a given data set.  The file name does
# not have to be 'user_stopwords.txt'.  To NOT use a user stopword file,
# comment the following line.

#user_stopword_file: /path/to/user_stopwords.txt

# [OPTIONAL] Specify the absolute path to a 'user' spelling file.  Use this
# file to give DocIndexer additional spelling corrections that should be
# performed on the token stream, but that are not contained in the default list
# of spelling corrections (found in the config folder).  This file can be used
# to remove or 'normalize' domain-specific slang.  The file name does not have
# to be 'user_spelling.txt'.  To NOT use a user spelling file,
# comment the next line.

#user_spelling_file: /path/to/user_spelling.txt

# [OPTIONAL] Whether to ignore hashtags, i.e. tokens such as #justinbieber.
# NOTE: this will ignore only those hashtags identified with the '#' tag by
# the part-of-speech tagger.  Hashtags used as proper nouns (^) or in other 
# meaningful ways will be kept.

IGNORE_HASHTAGS: No

# [OPTIONAL] Whether to ignore URLs and e-mail addresses.  Enabling this flag
# removes all tokens having a 'U' tag.

IGNORE_URLS: No

# [OPTIONAL] Whether to ignore at-mentions, i.e. long strings of numbers that
# begin with an '@' symbol.  Enabling this flag removes all tokens having an
# '@' tag.

IGNORE_AT_MENTIONS: No

# [OPTIONAL] Whether to ignore numbers, dates, times, etc.  Enabling this flag
# removes all tokens having a '$' tag.

IGNORE_NUMERALS: No

# [OPTIONAL] Whether to disable stemming in the CUSTOM_TWITTER analyzer.

DISABLE_STEMMING: No

# [OPTIONAL] Whether to disable all filters in the CUSTOM_TWITTER analyzer; if
# this option is selected, tokenization is the only operation performed on the
# data. Use this option if you want to see the full set of tokens that emerge
# from the tokenizer.

DISABLE_CUSTOM_FILTERS: No
